## Making the Web Safer, One Tag at a Time

Welcome to Windtunnel! This simple yet powerful Python script transforms your HTML files from using unsafe inline event handlers to employing secure external JavaScript files, allowed with CSP compliant hashes. The result? A cleaner, more maintainable codebase that's compliant with modern Content-Security-Policies, effectively giving you a tradeoff between nice developer experience (HTML with line handlers) and modern web security. All this, while you barely lift a finger. 🌟

### How to Use 🛠️

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip3 install beautifulsoup4 requests`.
2. **Run the Script**: Just execute `./wt yourfile.html`.
3. **Voila!** You'll find your updated HTML and new external JS files in the same directory.
